Figure S1: Scatter plots of leaf-mass-per-area (LMA, g/m2) predictions from both PLSR models with dashed 1:1 line. A) Predicted LMA values from the field (ASD) spectra vs observed values. B) Predicted LMA values from the AVIRIS-NG spectra vs observed values. C) Comparison between predicted values from both partial least square regressions that shows the bias in the ASD-predicted values compared to the AVIRIS predictions.

Figure S2: Scatter plots of water content (WC, %) predictions from both PLSR models with dashed 1:1 line. A) Predicted WC values from the field (ASD) spectra vs observed values. B) Predicted WC values from the AVIRIS-NG spectra vs observed values. C) Comparison between predicted values from both partial least square regressions shows the bias in the ASD-predicted values compared to the AVIRIS predictions

Figure S3: Difference in trait estimates between February and September 2022. A) Difference in LMA between the two dates, purple indicates areas were LMA decreased while green indicates areas were LMA increased. B) Difference in WC between the two dates, blue areas indicate increases in WC and brown indicates decreases in WC.

Figure S4: Maps of trait-based estimates of soil salinity in A) February and B) September, 2022. Darker colors indicate more saline portions of the marsh compared to the lighter colored regions.
